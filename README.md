# Udacity-Sensor_Fusion-Final_Project
This is my project for Udacity Self Driving Cars Nano Degree Second Module Sensor fusion Final Project

# Recap
## EKF
At first I started to follow lessons steps to implement EKF using the same equations but with small changes for system matrix F, process noise covariance Q and measurement matrix H to have finally a result but not satisfied one as the RMSE was higher than 0.35 and with some adjustments in parameters it still higher to finally realize the I am using the wrong results file and replace it to have the required RMSE = 0.32
